/**
 * üìù Notes for Contributors:
 * 
 * - When creating an interactive component, we recommend consuming the
 * component hook created.
 * 
 * For example, if you wanted to build an accordion component,
 * you'll first create a `useAccordion` hook and then create an `Accordion` component
 * 
 * - Ensure this component is properly theme-able by following [this guide](https://ui.luniand.com/docs/theming/component-style)
 * 
 * - Ensure the component is composable and can adapt to multiple use-cases
 * 
 * @see Guide https://ui.luniand.com/guides/component-guide
